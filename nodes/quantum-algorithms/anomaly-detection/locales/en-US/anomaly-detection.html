  <p>
      This node identifies the most anomalous values in the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number of shots refers to the number of times the circuit is run on each value. The greater the number,
      the greater the likelihood of successfully identifying anomalies, and the longer the execution time.
      A minimum of 5 is constrained for this algorithm.<br />
    <br />
      The number of standard deviations refers to the number of standard deviations outside the mean an input must be to
      be classified as an anomaly.<br />
