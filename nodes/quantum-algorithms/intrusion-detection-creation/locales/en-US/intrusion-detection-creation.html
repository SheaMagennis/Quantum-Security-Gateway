  <p>
      This node builds a model using labelled data inputted by the user.
      It performs One-Hot encoding and PCA dimensionality reduction on the input,
      before training a QSVC on the processed data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number of shots refers to the number of times the circuit is run to obtain
    a probability distribution of results. This is due to the probabilistic nature of qubit measurements.<br />
    <br />
      The Model Name refers to a name given to this model,
      with which it can be accessed once trained by the intrusion-detection node.

    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload
            <span class="property-type">json</span>
        </dt>
        <dd>JSON with headers for each field, one of which must be 'label', which must hold at least one 0 and one 1. Each header can hold an object of key:value pairs,
            one for each packet, with the key being a string index starting from '0', or alternatively an array of values. At least 3 records are required.</dd>
